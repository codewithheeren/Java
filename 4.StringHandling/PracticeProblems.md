### Problem 1: Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.

**Input:** "hello"
**Output:** "olleh"

### Problem 2: Count the Occurrences of a Character
Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of occurrences of each character in the string.

**Input:** "hello"
**Output:** h - 1 times, e - 1 times, l - 2 times, o - 1 times

### Problem 3: Check if a String is a Palindrome
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and otherwise returns False.

**Input:** "radar"
**Output:** Entered string is palindrome.

**Input:** "hello"
**Output:** Entered string is not a palindrome.

### Problem 4: Remove Duplicates from a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and removes all the duplicate characters, returning the modified string.

**Input:** "aabbcdd"
**Output:** "abcd"

### Problem 5: Capitalize the First Letter of Each Word in a Sentence
Write a function that takes a sentence as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word.

**Input:** "this is a sample sentence"
**Output:** "This Is A Sample Sentence"

### Problem 6: Count the Occurrences of a Specific Character in a String
Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of that character in the string.

**Input:** "hello world" and a character (e.g., "o")
**Output:** 'o' occurred 2 times in the entered string.

### Problem 7: Check if Two Strings are Anagrams
Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns True if they are anagrams of each other, and False otherwise.

**Input:** "listen" and "silent"
**Output:** Entered strings are anagrams.

**Input:** "hello" and "world"
**Output:** Entered strings are not anagrams.

### Problem 8: Remove All Whitespace Characters from a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and removes all the whitespace characters, returning the modified string.

**Input:** "hello world"
**Output:** "helloworld"

### Problem 9: Find the Longest Common Prefix Among a Group of Strings
Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among them.

**Input:** ["apple", "appetite", "apprehend"]
**Output:** The longest common prefix - "app"

### Problem 10: Convert a String to Uppercase or Lowercase
Write a function that takes a string and a flag indicating uppercase or lowercase conversion, and returns the modified string.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "Hello", and a flag indicating lowercase
**Output:** Modified string in lowercase, e.g., "hello"

### Problem 11: Swapping Two Strings Without Using a Third Variable
Write a function that takes two strings as input and swaps their values without using a third variable.

**Input:** "hello" and "world"
**Output:** Strings swapped, so the first string becomes "world" and the second string becomes "hello".

### Problem 12: Check if a String is a Rotation of Another String
Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns True if one string is a rotation of the other string, and False otherwise.

**Input:** "apple" and "leapp"
**Output:** True (since "leapp" is a rotation of "apple")

**Input:** "hello" and "world"
**Output:** False (since "world" is not a rotation of "hello")

### Problem 13: Reverse Each Word of a String in a Sentence
Write a function that takes a sentence as input and reverses each word in the sentence.

**Input:** "hello world"
**Output:** "olleh dlrow"

### Problem 14: Print the First Non-Repeated Character in a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and prints the first non-repeated character in the string.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "hello"
**Output:** The first non-repeated character, e.g., "h"

### Problem 15: Print All Duplicate Characters in a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and prints all the duplicate characters present in the string.

**Input:** "programming"
**Output:** r, g, m

### Problem 16: Print the Largest Word in a String Sentence
Write a function that takes a sentence as input and prints the largest word in the sentence.

**Input:** "This is a sample sentence"
**Output:** The largest word - "sentence"

### Problem 17: Reverse a String Without Using a Third Variable
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string without using a third variable.

**Input:** "hello"
**Output:** "olleh"
