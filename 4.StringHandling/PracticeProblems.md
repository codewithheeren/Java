# String Manipulation Problems

## Problem 1: Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "hello"
**Output:** The reversed string, e.g., "olleh"

## Problem 2: Count the Occurrences of a Character
Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of that character in the string.

**Input:** A string (e.g., "hello world") and a character (e.g., "o")
**Output:** The count of occurrences of the character in the string (e.g., 2)

## Problem 3: Check if a String is a Palindrome
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and False otherwise.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "radar"
**Output:** True (since "radar" is a palindrome)

**Input:** A string, e.g., "hello"
**Output:** False (since "hello" is not a palindrome)

## Problem 4: Remove Duplicates from a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and removes all the duplicate characters, returning the modified string.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "programming"
**Output:** Modified string with duplicates removed, e.g., "progamin"

**Input:** A string, e.g., "aabbcdd"
**Output:** Modified string with duplicates removed, e.g., "abcd"

## Problem 5: Check if a String is a Palindrome
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if it is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "radar"
**Output:** True (since "radar" is a palindrome)

**Input:** A string, e.g., "hello"
**Output:** False (since "hello" is not a palindrome)

## Problem 6: Count the Occurrences of a Specific Character in a String
Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of that character in the string.

**Input:** A string (e.g., "hello world") and a character (e.g., "o")
**Output:** The count of occurrences of the character in the string (e.g., 2)

## Problem 7: Check if Two Strings are Anagrams
Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns True if they are anagrams of each other, and False otherwise.

**Input:** Two strings, e.g., "listen" and "silent"
**Output:** True (since "listen" and "silent" are anagrams)

**Input:** Two strings, e.g., "hello" and "world"
**Output:** False (since "hello" and "world" are not anagrams)

## Problem 8: Remove All Whitespace Characters from a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and removes all the whitespace characters, returning the modified string.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "hello world"
**Output:** Modified string with whitespace removed, e.g., "helloworld"

## Problem 9: Find the Longest Common Prefix Among a Group of Strings
Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among them.

**Input:** A list of strings, e.g., ["apple", "appetite", "apprehend"]
**Output:** The longest common prefix, e.g., "app"

## Problem 10: Convert a String to Uppercase or Lowercase
Write a function that takes a string and a flag indicating uppercase or lowercase conversion, and returns the modified string.

**Input:** A string, e.g., "Hello", and a flag indicating lowercase
**Output:** Modified string in lowercase, e.g., "hello"

## Problem 11: Swapping Two Strings Without Using a Third Variable
Write a function that takes two strings as input and swaps their values without using a third variable.

**Input:** Two strings, e.g., "hello" and "world"
**Output:** Strings swapped, so the first string becomes "world" and the second string becomes "hello"
