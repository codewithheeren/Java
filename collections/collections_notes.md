**Collection Framework**

- **Array vs Collection**

**Array**

  - Fix in size
  - Arrays can hold only the same type of data i.e only homogeneous data types elements are allowed in arrays.
  - Do not implement any data structure.
  - Arrays can hold both object and primitive type data.

**Collection**

  - Dynamic in size
  - Collection, on the other hand, can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous elements.
  - Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure and hence for every requirement ready-made method support is available.
  - On the other hand, collections can hold only object types data but not the primitive type of data.

- **Collection**
  - A framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
  - Operations that you perform on data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
  - Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

  - **Collection methods**

1. add(obj)
2. addAll(collection obj)
3. remove(obj)
4. removeAll(collection obj)
5. contains(obj)
6. containsAll(collection obj)
7. clear
8. size
9. toArray
10. iterator()
11. isEmpty
